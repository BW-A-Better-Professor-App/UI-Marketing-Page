#A Better Professor App -- Marketing/UI

#Summary: As a professor, I have a lot of grad students I mentor. Iâ€™d like to help keep them on track, but I can never remember their project deadlines, or when my feedback to them is due. I need an app that allows me to enter in all the important dates by category (ie student project deadline, feedback deadline, letter of recommendation deadline, etc.) and automatically remind me or the student before the deadline. Never miss an opportunity to member ever again!
